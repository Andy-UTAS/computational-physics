# Computational physics _Ã  la_ Andy

Welcome to the code repository for computational physics as curated by Andy. The majority of my teaching takes place at the back end of the [University of Tasmania](https://www.utas.edu.au/) undergraduate degree, and consequently it is not uncommon that non-trivial calculations must be performed. It is my hope that I can generate `jupyter` modules which will teach techniques for solving the commonly encountered problems in physics, and in the best case, this content will be drawn from, and distributed across, all levels of our physics curriculum.

For any educators that may have stumbled across this site, I can thoroughly recommend the usage of [nbgitpuller](https://nbgitpuller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as a convenient way for distributing code to a class.
