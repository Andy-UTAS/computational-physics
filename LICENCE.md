Academic Free License ("AFL") v. 3.0

This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of
authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed a
notice in the Original Work subject to this License. The Original Work is
protected by copyright and/or other applicable law. Any use of the Original
Work other than as authorized under this License or copyright law is prohibited.

1. Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do
the following:

  a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a
  collective work;

  b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original Work,
  thereby creating derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original
  Work;

  c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works
  to the public, under any license of your choice that does not contradict the
  terms and conditions, including a license agreement;

  d) to perform the Original Work publicly;

  e) to display the Original Work publicly;

  f) to sublicense to third parties any or all of the rights granted herein.

2. Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by
the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor,
for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made,
and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.

3. Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form
of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation
describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable
copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work
that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation
by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository
reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long
as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.

4. Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any
contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may
be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express
prior permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any
rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual
property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted
to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent
claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. Nothing in this License
shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from
this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5. External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use, distribution,
or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the
Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those
works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application
intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder,
You agree that any External Deployment by You shall be deemed a distribution under Section
1(c).

6. Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that
You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original
Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an
"Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create
to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You
have modified the Original Work.

7. Warranty Disclaimer. LICENSOR OFFERS THE ORIGINAL WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE ORIGINAL WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE
OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE ORIGINAL WORK, EVEN
IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

9. Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work,
You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients
to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between
Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or
to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so without such
permission is void. This License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with these terms
and conditions.

10. Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer
exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action,
including a cross-claim or counterclaim, for patent infringement (i) against Licensor with respect
to a patent applicable to software, or (ii) against any entity with respect to a patent applicable
to the Original Work (but excluding combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware).

11. Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought
only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its
primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its
termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the
appropriate jurisdiction.

12. Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages relating
thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any
appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

13. Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall
be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
You agree that you have read and understand this License and that you agree to be bound by its terms and
conditions.
